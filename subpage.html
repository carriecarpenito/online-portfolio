<p style="text-align:left">Hi! My name is Carrie. I am 20 years old and from Monroe Township, New Jersey I am currently an IMM major with a minor in graphic design at TCNJ. I have enjoyed web and graphic design since I was a sophomore in high school. I enjoy coffee and music which is often reflected in my work.</p>
